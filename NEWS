Version 0.1.5

   libappstream-glib 0.5.0 installed.

New Features:
 - Add a Raspberry Pi firmware provider (Richard Hughes)
 - Add a simple config file to store the correct LVFS download URI (Richard Hughes)
 - Make parsing the option ROM runtime optional (Richard Hughes)

Version 0.1.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2015-07-25

Notes:
 - In this release we've moved the LVFS website to the fwupd project and made
   them work really well together. To update all the firmware on your system
   is now just a case of "fwupdmgr refresh && fwupdmgr update"
 - We've also added verification of BIOS and PCI ROM firmware, which may be
   useful for forensics or to verify that system updates have been applied.

New Features:
 - Actually parse the complete PCI option ROM (Richard Hughes)
 - Add a 'fwupdmgr update' command to update all devices to latest versions (Richard Hughes)
 - Add a simple signing server that operates on .cab files (Richard Hughes)
 - Add a 'verify' command that verifies the cryptographic hash of device firmware (Richard Hughes)
 - Allow clients to add new firmware metadata to the system cache (Richard Hughes)
 - Move GetUpdates to the daemon (Richard Hughes)
 - Move the LVFS website to the fwupd project (Richard Hughes)

Bugfixes:
 - Accept multiple files at one time when using fwupdmgr dump-rom (Richard Hughes)
 - Automatically download metadata using fwupdmgr if required (Richard Hughes)
 - Do not return NULL as a gboolean (Thomas Hindoe Paaboel Andersen)
 - Don't call efibootmgr after fwupdate (Mario Limonciello)
 - Fallback to offline install when calling the update argument (Mario Limonciello)
 - Fix Intel VBIOS detection on Dell hardware (Richard Hughes)
 - Reload appstream data after refreshing (Mario Limonciello)
 - Use the new LVFS GPG key (Richard Hughes)
 - Fix build: libgusb is required even without colorhug support (Jussi Kukkonen)

Version 0.1.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2015-05-28
